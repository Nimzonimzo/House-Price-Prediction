# House Price Prediction Project

This personal project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It involves exploring and analyzing real estate data, training predictive models, and evaluating their performance.

## Overview
The House Price Prediction project utilizes machine learning to forecast housing prices based on various features such as square footage and number of bedrooms. It involves data analysis, model training, and assessment to achieve accurate predictions.

## Objectives
1. **Price Prediction:** Implement machine learning models to predict house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.
2. **Feature Analysis:** Analyze the dataset to identify features influencing house prices significantly.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accurate predictions.
4. **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize different machine learning algorithms for prediction.
5. **Location Feature Addition:** Implement a feature providing information about the house location. Also, incorporate a feature measuring the distance to the nearest beach and Bouygues Télécom Mérignac (internship location).

## Technologies Used

## Code Explanation
- Data Generation: Generates synthetic data for apartments, including features like surface area, number of bedrooms, and prices.
- Random Coordinates Generation: Generates random geographical coordinates within the Bordeaux region for each apartment.
- Data Visualization: Utilizes various plotting libraries to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Implements machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression for predicting house prices. Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
- Cross Validation: Conducts cross-validation to assess model performance.
