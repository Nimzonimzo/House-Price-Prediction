# House Price Prediction Project

This is a personal project centered around predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The aim is to construct a model that can accurately forecast the price of a house based on its features.

## Overview
The House Price Prediction project is aimed at developing a machine learning solution to predict housing prices. This involves exploring and analyzing real estate data, training a predictive model, and evaluating its performance.

## Objectives
1. **Price Prediction:** Implement a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.
2. **Feature Analysis:** Explore and analyze the dataset to identify key features that significantly influence house prices.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure accurate predictions.
